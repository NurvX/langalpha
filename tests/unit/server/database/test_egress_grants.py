"""Ownership and atomicity of a workspace's egress grant set.

A grant is what lets a sandbox spend someone's OAuth credential, so three
contracts matter at this layer. ``connection_id`` is *selected* under the owner
predicate rather than trusted from the caller: another user's connection must
produce no grant at all, indistinguishably from one that does not exist. The
upserts and the retirement of everything else commit together — a grant set
that committed without its retirement half is an authorization overhang the
sandbox can still spend. And because the write is a whole-set *replacement*, it
is fenced by a workspace advisory lock plus a ``mcp_config_version`` CAS: two
workers cannot be merged by row locks (their sets need not overlap), so a
resolver carrying a superseded version must replace nothing at all.
