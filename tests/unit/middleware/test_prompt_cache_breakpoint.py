"""Integration test: prompt cache breakpoint placement across the middleware chain.

Verifies that the system message ends up with 2 content blocks in the correct
order, that the static prefix and the per-thread baseline each carry their own
cache_control, and that breakpoint 4 lands on the newest thing in the message
list that the next call will still carry: the turn row, not a third system
block and not the transient envelope.

Nothing appends a system block between the prefix and the baseline any more:
the skills manifest and the MCP roster are frozen into the baseline, which is
why breakpoint 2 sits on the static prefix's own block.

Middleware chain (first = outermost = runs first):
    AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware  ->  tags LAST block it sees with cache_control
    BaselineContextMiddleware  ->  appends the frozen baseline (block 1)
    TailEnvelopeMiddleware  ->  carries the rows in this model's shape

Expected final system message blocks:
    [0] static system prompt   (cache_control: breakpoint 2)
    [1] per-thread baseline    (cache_control: breakpoint 3)

Expected final message list:
    [..., HumanMessage([user input, turn row with cache_control])]
