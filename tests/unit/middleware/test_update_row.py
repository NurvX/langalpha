"""Settled contract of a change row: what moved, who moved it, what it means.

A change row is written once at a turn boundary and read for the rest of the
thread, so its words are the whole of what the model gets. It used to lead with
`**agent_md_changed** (2026-09-09T01:43:44+00:00, sandbox, main)`, which spent
the reader's attention on decoding provenance codes and a stamp the row's own
position in history already gave. It now states the fact in plain words and
carries its own explanation, because nothing in the system prefix says what a
change row is.
