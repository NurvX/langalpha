"""The platform contract: one surface vocabulary, and who writes its rules.

The surface a turn arrives on is declared by the caller, pointed at by the
turn's own row in history, and defined by a paragraph in that same row. Three
things are load-bearing enough to pin here.

The pointer has to survive a name this build has never seen, because the caller
owns the vocabulary and ships on its own schedule; a dropped pointer would be a
silent downgrade to the web shape. The symbol has to reach the model as its own
value rather than glued to the surface key, since that is the whole reason the
grammar has a suffix. And the split of who writes the rules has to hold:
``envelope/surface_rules.md.j2`` states a line of its own only for the surfaces
langalpha renders, and every other surface gets whatever its client sent in
``ChatRequest.surface_rules``, or nothing at all.
