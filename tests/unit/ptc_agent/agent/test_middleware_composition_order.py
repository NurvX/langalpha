"""CI guard: MultimodalStripMiddleware must be composed INSIDE ModelResilienceMiddleware.

Position in a LangChain ``middleware`` list is composition order — index 0 is
outermost. Resilience substitutes the model inside its own ``awrap_model_call``
via ``request.override(model=...)``, so a capability sanitizer placed outside it
reads the pre-fallback client and judges the request against a model that is not
the one being called.

That failure is silent. Nothing raises; the strip simply stops matching the real
target, and a vision-primary → text-only-fallback replays image blocks into the
400 the fallback existed to avoid. A comment cannot hold this invariant, so it is
asserted against the source of every stack that wires both.
