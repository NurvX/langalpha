"""
Public Share Router — Unauthenticated endpoints for shared thread access.

All endpoints use an opaque share_token instead of thread/workspace IDs.
No auth required. workspace_id is resolved server-side and never exposed.
A token resolves to a (workspace, path) scope; the file endpoints serve that
path and its subtree and nothing else, whatever path the URL asks for.

The metadata route also answers for a file or app share link, which is
what the ``/a/`` page dispatches on. It takes optional auth for that: a
private link opens for its signed-in owner and for nobody else.

This module carries the thread itself: the metadata a viewer opens and the SSE
replay, with the owner-only marks stripped out of every event. What the token
authorizes lives in ``share_access``, the file routes in ``share_files``, and
the branded failure page in ``share_pages``.

Endpoints:
- GET /api/v1/public/shared/{share_token}          - Thread, file or app metadata
- GET /api/v1/public/shared/{share_token}/replay    — SSE conversation replay
- GET /api/v1/public/shared/{share_token}/files     — File listing (requires allow_files)
- GET /api/v1/public/shared/{share_token}/files/read     — Read file content (requires allow_files)
- GET /api/v1/public/shared/{share_token}/files/serve/{path} — Serve file inline with sandboxed CSP (requires allow_files)
- GET /api/v1/public/shared/{share_token}/files/download — Download raw file (requires allow_download)
