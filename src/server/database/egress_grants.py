    One transaction: upsert a grant per connection, then revoke every other
    active grant of the workspace. Retirement is not optional cleanup — an
    active grant the resolved set no longer contains is an authorization
    overhang, since the sandbox may still hold that grant_id and a live relay
    JWT — so it must not be able to commit separately from the upserts.

    The relay dials ``destination_url``, and it is taken from the connection's
    consented ``server_url`` inside the INSERT — never from a caller argument.
    That is the whole security posture: a mutable catalog-row URL can never
    steer a grant at a host the token wasn't issued for. Connections are
    likewise *selected* under the owner predicate rather than trusted, so an id
    that is absent or another user's simply produces no grant (and is then
    retired like any other): a caller that guessed an id learns nothing. That
    same SELECT carries the servable-status predicate, since the upsert's
    ``status = 'active'`` would otherwise reactivate a grant on a connection
    that has since been revoked or needs re-auth.

    Returns None, having touched no grant row, when ``config_version`` no
    longer matches ``workspaces.mcp_config_version`` — the caller resolved
    against a superseded config and a newer sync owns the set. This is a
    whole-set replacement, so two workers cannot be merged by row locks: the
