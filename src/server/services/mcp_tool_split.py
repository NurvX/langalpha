"""Turn one server's discovered tools into what each path gets.

The composite install and the Flash binder both start from the same three
inputs, the vendor's list, the consent's denial and the row's binding plan,
and must land on the same split, or a tool could be wrapped for the sandbox
on one path and bound directly on the other. Folded names throughout, the way
the relay matches them, so a vendor that recases a name is treated the same
at every gate.
