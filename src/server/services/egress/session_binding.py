"""Egress-relay binding for one workspace session: grants, JWT, credential file.

The sandbox's only relay credential is a short-lived JWT plus a server→grant
map, written to a single file (`upload_egress_relay_credentials`). This module
owns the lifecycle of that file across the resolve path (`sync_egress_relay`)
and the warm fast path (`maybe_remint_egress_jwt`). The file is the ONLY place
a grant id reaches the sandbox — resolved server configs carry none, so a
retired grant cannot survive in a second channel.

Multi-worker contract: the `sandbox_egress_grants` table is the truth about
which grants exist — `EgressBinding` on the session is execution context only
(what THIS process last pushed), so a worker that never bound anything still
converges removals by reading the table. The grant replacement is whole-set for
this project's share of its machine, so it is fenced in the DB layer by the
owner's advisory lock plus a `mcp_config_version` CAS; the lock is the user's
because every project on a machine is that one user's, so two replacements
that could collide are two of theirs. A worker whose resolve was superseded is
told so and pushes nothing. The owner's database advisory lock stays held from
grant replacement through the whole-machine read and credential-file push.
Atomic replacement prevents a torn file; the lock prevents an older complete
map from landing after a newer one.
