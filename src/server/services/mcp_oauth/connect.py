"""Durable two-phase OAuth connect for user-level MCP servers.

Phase 1 (:func:`start_connect`, any worker): discovery + DCR via SDK helpers,
generate state + PKCE, persist the bridge record in Redis, return the
authorize URL. Phase 2 (:func:`complete_callback`, any worker): atomic
single-use claim of the state record, token exchange, encrypted bundle into
``user_mcp_oauth_connections``, best-effort host-side schema discovery.

Callback identity comes exclusively from ``state``; the post-connect redirect
