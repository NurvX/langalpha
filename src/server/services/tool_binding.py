"""Which path a granted MCP tool takes to the model: sandbox wrapper, JSON tool, or both.

One function decides, and everything that needs the answer calls it: the
resolver when it shapes a workspace's toolset, the grant sync when it records
what the relay must refuse to a sandbox caller, the tools endpoint when it
shows the user what is in force. Three readers computing the set three ways is
how the one-path-per-tool invariant would quietly stop holding.

Precedence, highest first: the user's per-tool override, the row's
``ptc_only`` preset, the group's default, and finally ``ptc``. The answer is then
clamped to the group's ``allowed_bindings``: one outside that set is replaced
by the group's default and reported as ``policy``, the source meaning nothing
on the row could move it. A group that names a single path therefore holds
every tool on it, whatever a map or a preset says, and the same clamp works
in either direction rather than only keeping a tool off the JSON path.

The preset has one value. A null preset is not a second setting but the
absence of one: each group's own default applies, which is what the row does
untouched, so turning the row switch off clears the column rather than
storing a word that would resolve to the same answer.
