"""What one sync pass saved, and every file it could not.

A caller acts differently per reason, which is why failures carry one rather
than being counted: ``too_large`` and ``path_too_long`` are refused the same
way by every later sync on this deployment, while the rest can save on the
next pass. A caller about to destroy the sandbox treats all of them alike,
since each is a file whose only copy is still in it.
