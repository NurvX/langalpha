"""Seam: mirroring the projects on one machine, all of them or only the changed.

One runtime serves every project on a computer, so a turn can write into any
of them and a teardown ends all of them. Both paths go through one loop,
fenced by the machine's durable sandbox ref.

The routine path after a turn syncs only the projects that changed.
Mirroring the turn's own project alone misses a sibling's edit or deletion
until that sibling's next sync, and a sandbox lost in between restores what
the user deleted. Syncing every project after every turn costs more the more
projects a machine holds (a no-change pass over four projects of 100k entries
measured 5.7 s, most of it shipping manifests both ways). A single exec that
compares change times against each project's scan mark finds the changed
projects instead (0.63 s for the same 100k entries), and the rest are
skipped. A pass before a teardown still mirrors every project: a shortcut is
not worth taking on the last chance to save a file.

One file of the ComputerManager split; see the package __init__."""
