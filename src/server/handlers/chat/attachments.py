"""Turning a turn's attachments into something the model can act on.

Every file the user attached takes one of three routes, decided by what this
turn's model accepts: a native content block, a sandbox path the agent opens
with Python, or a note saying the file exists and cannot be read. Which routes
are available is the difference between the two flavors, so they get a call
each rather than one function with a mode flag: PTC has a sandbox to upload to
and can name a path per file, Flash has neither and can only say what arrived.
