    Calculate accurate cost from per-call token usage records.

    This function calculates costs by processing each LLM call individually before
    aggregating, enabling accurate pricing for models with tiered pricing, 2D matrix
    pricing, or input-dependent pricing.

    Pricing the aggregate instead would push two small calls into a tier neither
    of them reached, so the records stay separate until after each is priced.

    Example:
        With tiered pricing (0-32k: $0.80, 32k-128k: $1.20):

        Incorrect (aggregated tokens): Two 30k calls → 60k total → Tier 2 pricing
        Correct (per-call): Two 30k calls → Each in Tier 1 → Accurate pricing

    Args:
