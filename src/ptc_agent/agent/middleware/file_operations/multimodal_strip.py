"""Read-side half of multimodal support: what the target model can still see.

An image or PDF block is written into graph state once, by the tool call that
produced it, and then replayed on every later turn. The model reading it is not
the one that wrote it — a user can switch mid-thread, a resilience fallback can
land on a text-only candidate, and a subagent runs its own model entirely — so
whether a block is legal is a question only this side can answer, on the call
where the target is actually known.

Split from ``multimodal`` because the two halves share no state and not every
agent wires both: the Flash assistant has no filesystem tool to intercept, but
still inherits history full of blocks it may not be able to read.
