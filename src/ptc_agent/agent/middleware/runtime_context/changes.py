"""Cross-writer change detection at the turn boundary.

The baseline block is frozen for an epoch, so a write that lands after it was
frozen is invisible to the model unless something says so. Detection is by
content hash at the turn boundary rather than by a write hook: a hook only sees
the writers it was installed on, and agent.md and memory both have writers
outside this process (the workspace-files API, a background subagent, another
worker). A hash comparison sees every writer, including the ones nobody
remembered to instrument.

What it emits is a diff against the frozen baseline text, not against the
previous turn: the baseline is what the model actually has in its context, so
the delta the model needs is always measured from there. This module owns the
reading and the diff; which of them becomes a row is decided once, in
``epoch.advance_epoch``.
