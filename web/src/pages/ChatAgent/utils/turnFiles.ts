 * renders and opens while the card for it never appears, and an embedded
 * `![chart](chart(1).png)` stops counting as embedded and earns a second,
 * duplicate card for what the reader is already looking at.
 *
 * A destination may carry a CommonMark title, which is not part of the path and
 * so rides in its own non-capturing group. Without it the closing paren had to
 * follow the destination directly, and `[report](results/report.pdf "Download")`
 * earned no card at all: not a deliverable, and for the image form not even an
 * embed, so a titled chart the reader is already looking at could still collect
 * a duplicate card from its Write call. The three title forms are the ones the
 * secretary's `_TITLE` already accepts.
 *
 * The label is bounded for the reason the secretary's twin already records
 * (`src/tools/secretary/utils.py`): the pattern is unanchored, so on a run of
 * `[` with no `]` an unbounded label rescans the line from every one of them.
 * That is quadratic, it runs on the main thread as a turn settles, and 512 is
