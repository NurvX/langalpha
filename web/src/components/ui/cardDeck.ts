/**
 * The card-deck motion: a stack of cards that fans open on a click.
 *
 * Several decks in the app use it (a turn's deliverables, a turn's sources,
 * the chat input's context snapshots) and they are meant to move alike, so the
 * geometry and the dismiss behaviour live here rather than being restated per
 * deck. They were restated, and the copies drifted: a card whose offset rides
 * `top` teleports to its open slot while only the last few pixels animate,
 * because nothing transitions `top` here. The fix landed in one copy.
 *
 * Sizes differ between decks on purpose and travel in `DeckGeometry`; the
 * formulas do not.

 * behind the front one, so a reader who had tabbed onto one of them was left on
 * `document.body`, with the next Tab starting over from the top of the page.
 * Only the keyboard path restores: a click elsewhere is the reader putting the
